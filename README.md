Getting started

Hello GitHub Geek-verse!

My name is Jai. I am painfully new to developing, but couldn't be more excited to jump right in and learn. The last time I coded anything was simple web-pages in the late 90's, but with all the changes to web-design, I consider myself a complete noob at this point. Any advice, assistance, or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
